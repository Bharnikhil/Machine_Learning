    "## 1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "- **Definition:** Average of absolute differences between predictions and actual values.  \n",
    "- **Formula:**  \n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  MAE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\hat{y}_i|\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Advantages\n",
    "- Easy to understand and interpret (average error in same units as target).  \n",
    "- Not overly sensitive to outliers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå Disadvantages\n",
    "- Treats all errors equally (does not penalize large mistakes heavily).  \n",
    "- Less useful when large errors are particularly undesirable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "- **Definition:** Average of squared differences between predictions and actual values.  \n",
    "- **Formula:**  \n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Advantages\n",
    "- Strongly penalizes large errors (squaring effect).  \n",
    "- Good for models where big mistakes are costly.  \n",
    "- Differentiable ‚Üí commonly used for optimization (e.g., gradient descent).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå Disadvantages\n",
    "- Unit of error is squared, harder to interpret directly.  \n",
    "- Outliers can dominate the metric.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "- **Definition:** Square root of MSE, bringing error back to the same unit as the target.  \n",
    "- **Formula:**  \n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Advantages\n",
    "- Same unit as target variable ‚Üí easy to interpret.  \n",
    "- Still penalizes large errors more than small ones.  \n",
    "- Popular and widely used in regression problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå Disadvantages\n",
    "- Like MSE, sensitive to outliers.  \n",
    "- Can sometimes over-penalize large errors compared to MAE.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# üìå Summary\n",
    "- **MAE** ‚Üí \"Average error size\" (simple, robust to outliers).  \n",
    "- **MSE** ‚Üí \"Punishes large errors more\" (good if big mistakes are costly).  \n",
    "- **RMSE** ‚Üí \"Typical error size in same units\" (intuitive + penalizes big errors).  \n"
