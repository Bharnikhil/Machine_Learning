    "## ðŸ”¹ What is a **Hyperparameter**?  \n",
    "In machine learning, **parameters** and **hyperparameters** are different:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters** â†’ learned automatically from the data (e.g., weights in linear regression, decision boundaries in SVM).  \n",
    "- **Hyperparameters** â†’ values that you **set manually before training**. They control **how the model learns**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Hyperparameters:\n",
    "- Learning rate in gradient descent  \n",
    "- Number of hidden layers/neurons in a neural network  \n",
    "- `alpha` (Î») in Ridge/Lasso regression  \n",
    "- `max_depth` in Decision Trees  \n",
    "- Number of clusters (k) in K-Means  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¹ What is **Hyperparameter Tuning**?  \n",
    "It is the process of **finding the best combination of hyperparameters** that gives the best performance for your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since hyperparameters arenâ€™t learned automatically, you must search for good values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Tuning Methods:\n",
    "1. **Grid Search** â†’ try all combinations from a predefined set  \n",
    "2. **Random Search** â†’ randomly try combinations (faster than grid search)  \n",
    "3. **Bayesian Optimization** â†’ uses probability to smartly explore the space  \n",
    "4. **Automated ML (AutoML)** â†’ frameworks like Optuna, Hyperopt, or sklearnâ€™s `RandomizedSearchCV` and `GridSearchCV`  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… In Short:\n",
    "- **Hyperparameters** = knobs you set before training  \n",
    "- **Hyperparameter tuning** = process of finding the best setting of those knobs to maximize model performance  \n"
